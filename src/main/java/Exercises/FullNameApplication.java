 * You will prompt the user to enter the parts of their name. You will then create a
 * new string that holds the userâ€™s full name.
 * The user will always have a first and last name, they may also have a middle
 * name and a suffix (ex. Jr, PhD). If a user does not enter a value for the middle
 * name or suffix, the full name should not include that part of the name. If the user
 * has a suffix in their name, the full name should include a comma before the
 * suffix.
